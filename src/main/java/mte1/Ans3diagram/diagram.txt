/*

Q3 [30 points]. Develop the UML diagram (with relationship, visibility modifiers, and appropriate notation, if possible) for all Java classes (from Q2). 
You may also draw the UML diagram on paper (if you do not want to use an online graphics/drawing program like draw.io). 
Please ensure that hand drawings and images are legible. 
Upload your solution image file or the diagram file (say, ans3-UMLdiagram-Kshetri.png) to your repository (inside diagram package) if you did it from draw.io.
